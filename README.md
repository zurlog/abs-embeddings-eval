## **Summary**
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered unprecedented research efforts across various disciplines. Notably, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to medical imaging has been prominently involved. Given the scarcity of resources in facing this devious disease, AI-based tools have emerged as potentially valuable assets to be harnessed. Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers a means to expedite the analysis of scientific articles on a larger scale, and has long been recognized as a solution to mitigate information overload in biomedical research. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the natural language processing (NLP) community has been consistently addressing the needs of domain experts by applying cutting-edge methods to enhance comprehension and knowledge discovery.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the adequacy of commonly employed biomedical transformer-based models, trained on pre-pandemic corpora, in capturing the semantic features present in medical imaging literature. Concurrently, we aim to observe the potential advantage of continual and citation-informed pretraining on COVID-19 literature.

To accomplish this, we introduce a unique and independent test set specifically focused on the medical imaging domain. This novel dataset serves as a valuable resource for the extrinsic evaluation of contextual embeddings, comprising realistic text classification tasks based on 560 gold labels referred to two target variables: the clinical task and imaging modality.
